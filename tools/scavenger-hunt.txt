1. We can get the IP Address using ifconfig. This gives the network information of all devices on the computer.
So if we want the IP address of our computer, we can look at the en0 interface, which
has an IP address of 137.22.165.63. If you want ethernet, look at the interfaces that begin with
eth.

2. You can find the IP address of a given host name by typing host <hostname>. This will give you the IP address of the hostname.

3. You can get the host name from the IP address using the command nslookup <ip address>.

4. To do this I would use scp. I would type in scp <source file path> sanghia@mantis.mathcs.carleton.edu:<destination file path>. 
This would prompt me for my password, and upon entering it my files would get copied over.

5. We can tell if a process is running on a given port on a given host by running nc -z -v <ip address> <port>. Doing so will tell you
if connection to that given port of that given host succeeded.

6. To scan for all open ports on a host, use nc -z <ip address> <port range>. The port range is the range of ports you would like to be 
checked, since there is no definite number of ports available.

7. To download and save a webpage, use wget <url> to downlaod and save the webpage at the url. This will save the HTML file of the website to your 
local file system. If you try to wget an https website though, you'll get a 

8. To view headers of HTTP responses, use curl -T <url> and this will give you all headers.

9. To get the headers your computer sends, run curl --head <url>.
