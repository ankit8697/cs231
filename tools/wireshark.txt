2. The port used by the client is 40270. It uses a port so that the server knows which application to send data to.

4. The full content of the frame is: 59308 21-04-04 18:08:57 50 0 0 267.2 UTC(NIST) *
The 21-04-04 represent the date, 18:08:57 represents the time, 59308 is the MJD number, 50 represents whether or not we are on daylight savings time. This is the DST flag. The 0 after this is the LS flag. The DST flag and LS flag give advance notice of the transitions to and from daylight saving time and of the imminent occurrence of a leap second, respectively. The next 0 is the health, where a nonzero value means there is some error in the time. The last number is the advanced time is ms, which is the time taken for the packet to go from the server to the client. The * at the end is for compatibility with a different format.

5. SYN means synchronous which is the number sent from the client to the server to initiate the handshake.

6. ACK means acknowledgement which is sent as a response to tell the requester that the message has been received.

7. FIN means finished which closes the connection.

8. The server initiated the closing of the connection. We can tell because the server sent the FIN request first.

===== HTTP =====

1. 2 TCP connections were opened.

2. There is a GET request for the webpage. The summary is 7	0.044543300	172.18.210.251	45.79.89.123	HTTP	415	GET /index.html HTTP/1.1

3. We can tell that there was a request for the image because of the GET request. The summary is 11	0.102214700	172.18.210.251	45.79.89.123	HTTP	384	GET /jeff_square_head.jpg HTTP/1.1

===== QUESTIONS =====

1. How useful is Wireshark at looking at packets other than HTTP and TCP packets?
2. Is there any point to looking at HTTPS packets since they're all encrypted?
3. How do you use this for any other kinds of packets on the network?
